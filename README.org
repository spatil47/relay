#+TITLE: Wireless Power Squid
A [[http://webiopi.trouch.com][WebIOPi]] -based system for turning outlet-powered devices on and off.

The goal is to add automation to the [[http://clubs.njit.edu/ieee/][IEEE club space]] at [[http://njit.edu][NJIT]].

* Installation
1. Install the dependencies listed.
2. Clone repository into your home directory.
3. Run `./setup` and follow the interactive prompts.

** Dependencies
- Python v2.x
- WebIOPi

* Issues/ToDo
- We need to add scheduling functionality to the web interface.
- We need to create the `./setup` installation script.
- When the WebIOPi server is started in standalone mode, the relays turn on and off for a second. This needs to be fixed soon.
- When the web interface is loaded for the first time after starting the WebIOPi server, the relays all turn on at the same time. This needs to be fixed soon.
